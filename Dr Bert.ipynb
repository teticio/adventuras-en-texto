       " 'Yeah, absolutely. So meeting somebody new for the first time and in this setting is anxiety provoking ... and maybe that’s similar to what you’re saying is you take on these things you agree to do these things but actually what you end up feeling quite is anxious about it.',\n",

And just feeling, just feeling as if there was, overwhelmed, too much going on. And yet when I sat down and tried to work it out, because I like to be able to do that, I like to be able to say 'this is connected to this', when I tried to put my finger on was there one specific thing, I couldn’t do that, there was a collection of small things which, when I looked at them each in turn…\",\n",
       " 'They were all manageable.',\n",
       " '… they were all manageable but the collective seemed to be a bit overwhelming really.',\n",
       " 'Okay. Okay. And these things that felt overwhelming were they all placed, you know, to do with one aspect of your life or is this a kind of general…',\n",
       " 'I think that they probabl ... when I think about it there were probably aspects of work, but it’s not exclusive to work, there’s other things ... there’s things within the home, just very practical things like, maybe, some DIY at home that I really should have done, you know that but that’s a very simple and ... it sounds to me like a very trivial example, but it…',\n",
       " 'Yes, but what you’re saying is it’s not one thing ... so the individual doing the bit of DIY is not problematic, but feels problematic because all these other things are there…',\n",
       " '… because there’s so many of them. Yeah, yeah.',\n",
       " 'Okay. So is that something that feels new? That you’ve taken on such an array of things. Is that something you’ve done in the past?',\n",
       " 'I think I’m very good at taking on things, and I’ve done that in the past. Erm, but I suppose that they’ve always been manageable. I’ve always managed to work through them. Even though I might have, in my head, a list of things to do…',\n",
       " 'Right.',\n",
       " 'They’ve always been, they’ve always been achievable and they’ve always been ... sort of ... I’m struggling a bit for the words here ... erm, I suppose it’s a matter of me ... I’ve always managed to break them down and deal with these things one at a time so they haven’t been overwhelming, but I suppose that I can identify that I’m very good at saying yes I’ll do something ... and especially if it’s a few months down the line ... I’ll say yes to them and then all of a sudden what was a few months down the line suddenly is, you know, next week ... or today.',\n",
       " 'Sure. Okay. So that thing of saying yes is something you really resonate with and feels like that’s part of who you are.',\n",

       " 'Okay. So, do you make any sense of that? What’s your understanding of why you say yes?',\n",
       " 'I think that I say yes because I find it difficult to say no. And I suppose that sort of linked in with that is ... I don’t like to sort of let people down, I don’t want to disappoint people.',\n",
       " 'Okay, so I guess that that would be very alive in our meetings, that there would be a part of you I guess that would want to get it right or wouldn’t want to let me down maybe.',\n",
       " 'Yes, yeah, I can see that, yeah ...',\n",
       " 'Okay. So that’s just for us to kind of notice and recognise really, because there may be times in here where you do want to challenge something I say or maybe you don’t want to turn up one week, you may want to go do something else. What might that feel like ...',\n",
       " 'Right.',\n",
       " ' ... to not make the appointment or ... not get it right?',\n",
       " 'Right, yeah ...',\n",

       " 'Yes, as soon as you said it and as soon as I thought about it, that doesn’t feel, that doesn’t sit well with me, that doesn’t feel comfortable.',\n",
       " 'So it would be really difficult to do that?',\n",
       " 'Yes.',\n",
       " 'So it must be very hard for you to say no to things, even when it feels like it’s another demand.',\n",
       " 'Yes, yeah ... I think I can do it, but it doesn’t ... it’s hard. It’s hard for me to do.',\n",
       " 'Okay. Do you want to say a bit about that?',\n",
       " 'Er ... I don’t quite know where to go with that.',\n",
       " 'Okay, that feels a bit uncomfortable or ...',\n",
       " 'I feel a bit stuck there.',\n",
       " 'Okay. So that might be really helpful for us to see that that’s a place where it feels stuck ... that’s it’s difficult to even imagine saying no to somebody, refusing to do things, in a kind of easy way. That it would be something quite challenging.',\n",
       " \"Yes, I have to kind of prepare myself for that. It’s far easier for me to say 'Yeah, go on, I’ll do it, that’s fine, put my name down' or 'I’ll take that on', whereas if I ... I’ll have to get to the point where I’m thinking, there’s too much going on for me to actually, I suppose, to myself to the point where I can turn around to somebody and say 'No, I can’t do that', and so the easier option is to say 'Yes, yeah, I’ll do that'.\",\n",

       " 'Yes, sure.',\n",
       " \"It seems as I’m sitting here, as I’m talking about it, logically it seems it would be far easier if I just, when they first asked me, just to say 'No, I can’t do that'.\",\n",
       " \"But it may be almost habitual that you say 'yes'. It sounds like it’s become a real pattern for you.\",\n",

       " 'What’s come to mind there is that ... er ... my strategy for getting through secondary school. I remember leaving the standard small primary school and going into secondary school which was a comprehensive in Liverpool and suddenly I was, I remember the first day of standing there and just being I suppose overwhelmed by, by the size of the new place I’d got to, and I think as a strategy for coping fairly early on in that school was a kind of, was to sort of keep your head down, and sort of just get on with it, and I suppose maybe the connection there might be sort of not be resistant to stuff and be compliant with stuff ...',\n",
       " 'Right.',\n",
       " ' ... but I don’t know whether that’s right, but certainly as you were talking about those early memories that’s a very powerful memory of me, of how I got through secondary school ... if you keep your head down then, then people won’t target you.',\n",
       " 'Okay.',\n",
       " 'Yeah.',\n",
       " 'Okay. Sounds like it was quite a hard school.',\n",

       " 'And I guess that’s the bit that feels really relevant, that that was your experience, your experience of going to that school on that first day, was that it was big and scary and that somehow or other you needed to find a method of staying safe, and keeping your head down and being compliant and saying yes was what happened.',\n",
       " 'Mm.',\n",
       " \"What about in your home, was your home a place where you could say 'no'?\",\n",
       " 'Er ... the memories I have of home is that the home was a very safe place, erm ... I think that ... I don’t think I said no, I don’t think it was, I don’t think I was ... I don’t think there was anything there that I’m aware of that I would’ve been concerned about ... like I say it felt a very safe place, a very loving place.',\n",
       " 'Right.',\n",
       " '... so I didn’t get hit or shouted at but I don’t know whether that’s because at that point I’d already developed this sort of, you know, just keep quiet, I never really thought that far back ...',\n",
       " 'Right, okay.',\n",

       " 'Yeah.',\n",
       " 'There may be or there may not be. The connection might be that home did feel safe and it wasn’t a place where you were avoiding conflict. So maybe going to the secondary school was the stark contrast to that ...',\n",
       " 'Right.',\n",
       " ' ... a place that really didn’t feel safe.',\n",
       " 'Yeah, that feels more like it.',\n",

       " 'Yes, yeah. Yes. I remember a work colleague many years ago say that I have this, how did he describe it, because he was quite an active person in standing up and shouting, or standing up and making his point felt, and he described me as having a cloak of invisibility ... that I just found a level to get on with and drift through I suppose.',\n",
       " 'Okay.',\n",

I’ve always seen it as a fairly useful strategy but now maybe it’s not, if that’s ...\",\n",
       " 'Well, and maybe it’s both, because I think that you know what you’ve described happening to you at really quite a young age at school was that you naturally found a method of coping that actually did work, it sounds like. You didn’t get picked on at school, you did manage to find a way through it, and actually that served you very well, most of the time. But perhaps what you’re saying to me is it’s not serving you so well right now.',\n",
       " 'Right. Yes.',\n",
       " 'Maybe there’s something that’s changed in your life at the moment, or the situation’s changed whereby that method of coping is becoming a problem.',\n",
       " 'Well yes. Yeah, yeah. I can see how that connects and I can see that what’s going on for me at the moment is not good in the sense that I’m getting to the point where I’ve been relatively sort of anxiety free and yet now I actually feeling as though I’m ... that that’s not what’s going on for me at the moment.',\n",
       " 'Yes. Okay. So shall we go back to that six weeks ago because it feels that that was really relevant, that something really changed for you at that point. And what you’re saying is that it’s not really clear what that was in particular. Had you taken on more than normal?',\n",
       " 'I’m really not aware that I’d taken on any more than usual, and when I ... As I say, when I sat down and tried to work it out I couldn’t ... I couldn’t put my finger on, well I said earlier, I can’t put my finger on one thing, it just seems like a collection of things really so I’m hard pushed to think is there something specific happening, erm ...',\n",
       " 'Maybe unconnected, I mean sometimes it can be something like an anniversary or a birthday or a whole range of things, but it feels like something shifted for you.',\n",
       " 'Yes, um ... I ... all that springs to mind there is that I’ve been working at the same place for 25 years, and that happened around that time that it was, that it was acknowledged that I’d been working at the same place for 25 years, and so ... I ... I don’t know where that came from, I mean apart from you saying anniversary, because I really can’t think that that is necessarily connected to me feeling anxious, but it might be.',\n",

There’s things I’d like to, or I think I’d like to do ... and then find reasons not to do them. And so there’s obvious things when I say to other people that I’ll do something and then I’ll be in a situation where I have to do it, or will say no, but there’s little things that I also kind of expect from me, there’s things I want to do for myself, some of which I put off, and I suppose when I put them off I then ... I don’t think I ever really give myself a hard time about it, but it’s just something else I’ve put off and I feel as though I’d like to do. An example of that might be erm,  ... years ago I felt as though I was quite creative, I’d sit and draw, I’d play guitar, I’d write and er, ... I still play guitar and I still sort of promise myself that I’m going to sit down and draw, but I think that sort of laughingly, I say to myself 'Oh that’s the kind of thing that I’ll do when I retire'. I’ll take up watercolours when I retire, so I always manage to put something off, and yet there’s part of me that thinks that’s really important. That it’s really important for me to do these things for me, and then I don’t do them. And then I feel kind of, I do know, well I’m not sure what I feel about that really. I feel a bit sort of, the word that springs to mind is, I feel a bit disconnected.\",\n",

And so I actually think I’m very open to this idea of get it wrong and you learn something from it, and yet that is exactly what’s not going on when it comes to sitting down and being creative. Which I just ... and that’s brand new to me. I’ve never thought about it, never made that connection. I can say that just doesn’t make, that really genuinely doesn’t make sense to me.
