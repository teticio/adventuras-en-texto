You reach down, you flip the tortoise over on its back. The tortoise lays on its back, its belly baking in the hot sun, beating its legs trying to turn itself over, but it can’t, not without your help. But you’re not helping. Why is that?</b></i> Because ’I don't give a shit about a tortoise, I've been around for forty years and I've fought wars’ But, though Leon is wounded, you don't give a shit because ’I'm a coward, we need help, they're coming. They're crawling up the side of a hill, and out in the distance you see a red and blue and white patch’ And suddenly, you start running with Leon. I've seen tanks burn before, but this is hot’ But again, you run after them, running against the never ending dangers of the desert. You see a red, yellow and white rectangle ’this is the Death Star’ and suddenly, something terrible happens. A giant cylindrical object is burning through the sky. As you watch it burn, an explosion’ the blob of smoke ’clears the horizon as it floats up to us, a huge, blazing white globe’ charging towards us. And you watch it right behind you on that gigantic globe. You rush toward it, aim, blast. But not, because you don't care. You're watching the Death Star do one amazing thing, and now, the heroes’and the galaxy’are going down’<|endoftext|>People change, jobs change, progress stagnates. The topic of video game marketing, the platform that supposedly gave rise to entire forms of entertainment, seems and always has been relegated to the back of main headlines and unreported blogs. And if you're looking to game makers in particular, this is becoming a problem because there's still a bit of quality control to this idea that a publication that hopes to expand a market, is going to put their whole company at risk for another outlet to copy and paste to their liking, instead of producing something unique to their audience.<br><br>It's easy to get into this territory. Why should an animated RPG be your exclusive lifestyle knowledge, compared to the world of Minecraft or Portal? I've heard it's because game makers don't always know how to sell their product well enough to encourage the hardcore gamers that make the title popular, and are sometimes unable to convince people to spend a month or more just for that core multiplayer experience.<br><br><br>It's not that all game designers are nukers. Many are commercial designers of diverse styles and language tones who want to sell their designs across platforms, including still-useable games like Minecraft. If you want to compare your game design to a 5 year old game you did on two</p>"

A hundred points, sir – a hundred points – just give me a sign – give me a sign, you’ll be docked one hundred points – you’ll be docked one hundred points – give me a sign – you’ll be docked one hundred points – you’ll be docked one hundred points – what’s that?’\n",

Dumbledore told Hagrid to look for Dumbledore in the woods when he was passing through, and Hagrid followed him. Hagrid has been passing Dumbledore rumours about you all this time … you never really took Harry’s name when you were apart of the Triwizard Tournament. I was rather surprised when Dumbledore told Hagrid to send you an owl before we got to the World Cup. Only a very few of your old friends still call themselves friends with you, and I think they might be tempted to take sides against you if they heard what Dumbledore has in store for you this time –’\n",

However, when the Weasleys arrived with lunch on the table, Hagrid said he was waiting in the corridor. He did not look too keen about returning to his old ways, though; he was obviously very relieved to be back doing ordinary chores, and would not accept an iced gingerbread house-elf biscuit.\n",

Harry felt a twinge of sympathy for her, though he doubted if she would have dared say this if Mrs Weasley had not been tormenting him. Hermione was frowning, glowering, over her shoulder as she hurried to patching a large hole in a hard surface with her napkin, evidently under the impression that Harry had touched her.\n",

Harry was sitting in his fourth floor room, having finished packing for the day, when Voldemort’s followers burst through the door behind him. One of them brandished a large club, and the Weasleys’ windows were shattered by the impact. A second wizard hit Harry on the back of his neck; his glasses fell off and shattered; and he was barely holding on as Ron put him under an enormous amount of pressure.\n",

He knew he wasn’t alone; he had barely noticed the great black eyes staring back at him as the door closed\n",

            "‘We sold the rights to resurrect you from the dead, didn’t we, Mr Crouch?’ he growled, and his eyes were glinting, piercingly, in every direction.\n",

            "‘Right next door, you say?’ Malfoy grunted, and Harry saw him lift his hands to hit the partition, but it wasn’t enough to stop Kreacher penetrating their pockets, and pulling out the living creature’s soul.\n",
            "\n",
            "‘This is the one we’re going to get it from,’ said Kreacher loudly and clearly. Harry saw his fingers shaking as he pulled out the soul. There was something about its rough, cold skin that caused the fingers to skid slightly.\n",
            "\n",
            "‘I was joking,’ said Malfoy suspiciously, ‘in the book … they resurrect the dead all the time … you’re not the first one they’ve resurrected, are you?’\n",

            "Kreacher pulled out a tiny, bloodthirsty looking creature – a rat – and put it into an empty compartment. Harry watched nervously as it bit its way through the others, trying to get at the living creature. It tried desperately to bite the ghost. Harry was very glad, therefore, that he was next to Malfoy, for the rat bit him so badly he had to be carried away unconscious. As he opened his eyes, he saw the same thing – an enormous black snake was descending upon Kreacher, driving it into the ground – blood was gushing from its end – he clutched the railings of the compartment door as the snake devoured them, and knew he was toast.\n",
            "\n",
            "His death was no consolation to Harry, however, for a second snake was about to descend upon him. He clutched the railings desperately to his chest, so that the second snake wouldn’t cut him – he didn’t want those nasty black fangs of the first one, he just needed to cling desperately to the ones in front of him. The second snake lunged around the compartment door, and started to cut it in two. Harry clutched the railings to the doorframe, whilst desperately hoping the second snake wouldn’t touch him. He certainly hadn’t wanted or expected it to. The door creaked slightly, but did not budge; Harry let go. He had two choices – get up, and try and defend himself, or stay here, and watch the second snake rip the door in half. He did as the first one had done, and leant against the wall.\n",
            "\n",
            "And lo! Another rip in the door erupted into life, and squeaked, boomed, and squeaked – Harry heard the second snake coming, and leant against the wall even harder. And just as he had thought, the second snake was within six inches of him. There was nothing he could do about the door – the second snake had finished his task, and entered the compartment, and was forcing its way through the other girls. A second, quieter, little giggle escaped Harry; he stood there, terrified, in terror – he had been so sure the second snake was finished, he hadn’t even felt anything at all … then the door opened.\n",

The crowd laughed; a cat jumped on his foot, but Harry threw it aside; he ran as fast as his foot would carry him, kicking and stamping on stones; more effigies of Lord Voldemort loomed large over the sides of his cell, and Harry was soreling towards him as though he was drunk; he had no intention of giving up this foolish hope. He wanted more than anything to hear more about Lord Voldemort. He wanted to know what drove him. He wanted to know whether he was a good or a bad ruler. He wanted to know whether he really controlled everything that was left of Lord Voldemort’s army.\n",

At half past one, he entered the living room with his mother and grandmother, who were both laughing and talking happily.

He waited, staring at the Hall, his face still in shadow, as the hundreds and hundreds of witches and wizards in the stands stood, cheered on by the cheering crowd at the top of their voices, and the motionless body of Sirius Long stood before the silver plateecker, its golden eye staring through the mink cloak it was wearing now.\n",

And they had been waiting for him; Ron and Hermione, along with Filch, the ferret – now Harry appeared, they knew he had waited until all four of them had gone into the forest; they had followed him anyway, because the map hadn’t been working properly – they had followed Cedric and Fleur’s advice, they had followed the map up to the top of the Green Pumpkin, and they had realised that there was nothing there but sand.

One of the attackers was holding the club in a bulldrome-like position by the victim's stomach, while the other threw the club into the air and struck the victim in the face with it. Sometimes the victim was knocked backwards; sometimes he was thrown forwards; sometimes he was kicked; sometimes he was stabbed; and sometimes he was crushed to death with his own club.

What if they decide to leave? What if one of them gets ill or needs changing or something? We all feel those kinds of circumstances, we all worry about those kinds of things … Well, we can help. The Quidditch World Cup starts this summer, and as anyone who has been following Quidditch knows, the Quidditch World Cup is usually one of the biggest affairs of the year. Things can go terribly wrong in the middle of a match, or they can go remarkably right. Fortunately, not much happens between the teams during the World Cup, except for the players changing teams and losing their jobs. That is, unless you count Iran getting eliminated in the Quarter-Finals and having to start all over again. That happened once before, in the Opens, and that was back when Croatia were the defending champions. Of course, things could always and presumably go wrong between the teams during the Tournament, and that happened once before, of course. Back in the Days of Boris and Bobby, and possibly even back when there weren’t any champions. It happened a few times, mostly in Ancient Rome, and was called Consolation Quidditch.

Besides, there was the matter of Dumbledore’s rather suspicious silence recently, in the wake of Rita Skeeter’s piece accusing the former Head of Magic of sexual abuse. Even if Dumbledore did want to drop the matter of the rumours, he was still less likely to do so than his elder brothers – Snape, it transpired, had been saving his promotion for himself, and Harry was still far from certain that he was fit for the position. What Snape really wanted was to be Head of the Department of Magical Games and Sports, where he would have total control over the selection and conduct of the magical competitions. If Dumbledore allowed this, Snape would be in a very difficult position. He might even have to accept Harry’s invitation to compete in the Triwizard Tournament, the greatest sporting occasion of the year.\n",

The Hogwarts High Inquisitor, McGonagall, had recently returned from the Burrow, and made it very clear that she considered all of the Weasleys to be 'Muggle-lords and hacks like them'. Dumbledore did not seem to share this view, however. When Rita Skeeter’s article appeared in the Daily Prophet, Dumbledore did not appear to share Rita’s verdict that the Weasleys were nothing short of thieves. Sirius, Crabbe and Goyle were all expelled from the Weasley household at the end of the first task, and without a doubt contributed significantly to its downfall.

Harry bent down, picked up the ginger bulb and cradled it in his trembling hands.\n",

The window behind the counter was boarded up; the owner of which seemed to have thought better of opening up during the Boxing Day stock market crash of 1987, so that he and his family could no longer use the stairs. Harry remained unseen as the bakery delivered its annual Christmas dinner. Pots and pans lined the walls.\n",

He felt a slight sense of foreboding. What were they going to do with all these measurements, anyway? Harry had only ever carried a small scale model of a house down the corridors; how would they be transported up here? And what would they find inside this enormous castle?\n",

            "Harry turned and saw that some of the castle’s many tapestries were decked out in tapestry, including the tapestry that covered the Entrance Hall. The Great Hall, which usually had a tapestry play set in the corner, had now seven tapestries; all of them were of different distasteful intent. Mad and feverish green, all of them; crayfish, crocodile and dragon heads, all painted over in blood-red; a morbid mixture of sand and blood. It was enough to make Harry uncomfortable, even though he\n",

The left hand path he had taken had taken him very quickly from where he had found Voldemort, away from the house-elf thing, and this, combined with the fact that he did not recognise the place where he had found Voldemort at all, had enabled Voldemort to assume the identity of anyone who might walk the path.

            "Harry stared at Moody. He had a vague idea that this was what Dumbledore paid him to do; it was a bit like being stuck in Azkaban with Moody and the other Death Eaters. Long black tables and chairs stood in front of the walled maze, facing the spectators, each with its own detailed description of the maze and its contents. The wall opposite the entrance to the office was covered with a new kind of marble, well beyond what Harry had ever seen there before. It was lined with thousands and thousands of tiny images, all of different sizes and found in a kind of painterly wonderland. Some of them were of very little interest; lawns and gardens from miles around were neatly stacked in neat rows, alluding to the fact that the watchers in the office were very busy. But as long as Moody was pointing his wand at something, Harry would think he was on duty, until he saw the next thing moving in the gallery.\n",

It was half-filled with yellowish blue liquid; about a foot-and-a-quarter high, and covered with a kind of slimy translucent grime. Next to it, and on the right-hand side, a bronze statue of a clown with cackling red eyes and a mop of reddish hair rose from the wooden seat. Below them, all around the gallery, fifty or so miniature models of variously sized magical creatures glided, one after another, into Moody’s palms. Each of these miniature creature was numbered and numbered, and was, if Harry’s maths were right, larger than a duffel bag.\n",
            "\n",
            "Moody took care, on reflection, that the remainder of the moat surrounding the grounds never got too full. He and Snape made a good squad of Hogwarts students drink at least a pound each, to see how long they would stand patiently staring at the laughing, giggling merpeople. All the students who hadn’t wilted or gone purple with rage by the time they got to their feet, thanked Moody and Snape profusely for keeping them company. The teacher came and took their samples away, and they saw Madam Pomfrey standing at the gargoyle entrance, examining a small girl, who had twitched slightly when Wormtail’s egg released her.\n",

Then he took off at top speed, and as he sped away from the grounds he looked down at the girl in his arms and knew he was bringing her back to his hut.

            "He stared up at the sock, in the dim light streaming from the hole in the wall, and saw, for the first time, how narrow and deep the sock was. It was made of bone, and very heavy – but it was also recognizable as Peeves’s.\n",
            "\n",
            "‘Peeves,’ he said, looking around at his old sock-sleeves, which were now sticking out at an angle, so that they were pointing towards him. ‘How do you do, Fawkes? Easy perhaps … but where did you get those?’\n",

They set off across the dreary field, wind and misty paths crackling with lightning as they marched, and Harry’s feet almost carried him off his feet at one point. But before he had reached the narrow footpath leading to the edge of the Forest, he saw something very interesting. A large grouping of people were standing in a small patch of grass on the hillside. All of them had their wands out, and were looking up at the mysterious, iron-grey halo of the Forest.\n",

Nearly all of the people on the other side of the grass had jumped. Somewhere between twenty and thirty pairs of feet tall, all moving in synchrony, each pulling on a branch, Harry pulled on the little one and fell at their feet.\n",

You can take your chances if you are short of names, Weasley. Muggle registration is going to cost about a pound a head.’\n",

As a rule, I prefer older wizards over young ones,’ he added, to loud gasps from those in the stands. ‘But I must admit, I seldom get more than two or three extra members from my own departments when we go to international competitions.

A dull knot formed in him that night, as he imagined what would happen if Bagman had not intervened – if Cedric hadn’t come. He had always pictured Cedric in the crowd, waiting for the golden whistle to blow, his hand on his forehead, shaking his wand in frustration. Harry sat and thought about that, and what he would feel if Bagman hadn’t intervened. He had to ask Cedric if he wanted to come with him. Go with Ron and Hermione. Go home. See if Harry could get past the Diggorys. Try and force Bagman to let Harry join the Ministry of Magic.\n",

He went into a rage, thinking about blockingading the hospital wing, but that was an idea Gerard owed Harry, and they talked about other things to occupy their time.

He was still tightly wrapped in his dressing-gown. Pigwidgeon was still bartering for something to eat with him.

            "\n",
            "‘Okay,’ said Cedric, and he went quiet for a moment, staring at the ground. Then he said, ‘Oh, Harry, I’ve decided. I think I know your role. You know where you want to be, do you?’\n",

            "‘Hang on,’ she said, ‘there’s something going on at the bottom … something’s definitely amiss. Maybe – maybe Fawkes can’t be trusted … he’s been awful, really awful. He recycled the same number so many times it’s become sort of a habit.’\n",

They put glitter all over everyone’s hands when they go off at the top, and glare at each other whenever they go near each other. Winky got them into her way a few times, though, and she had to tuck them in for the night.’\n",

            "But she fell off her toes. Harry and Ron chanced a glance at them, and saw that they were both extremely annoyed.\n",

It was much more colourful than he had ever seen it there; every inch of the stone walls were adorned with something that resembled colourful cushions, or straw, or glitter, or anything that would make a person happy. He saw Professor McGonagall holding a royal-blue velvet couch in which to watch the Slytherins wrestle Rupture the Red to Death. Other people were also sitting on this same purple-and-gold rug, though Harry couldn’t see any by the time they reached the Gryffindor table. Most people were either snoozing lightly on their benches, or were having a very hard time talking at all, as the atmosphere was very uncomfortable.\n",

I was only twelve years old when Dumbledore put me in charge of this school. I was supposed to be a gentle reminder that Muggles do not run this school, and that wizards do. I was supposed to teach them this lesson, this night-time slog, this fear, this reliance upon dark wizards. I was told at Hogwarts that I must teach them how to deal with dark magic.

They moved slowly, and with subtle waggling wings, and were clearly not human. As Harry slowed down to talk to the pub, he saw one of them blow a bubble containing what looked like a freshly fallen twig onto its shoulder, which bent into a small broomstick which it was swinging with its back legs. A second leaned upon a branch and blew a small orange feather at him.

It sounded as though Dumbledore had told Ron that he would get everyone else on the trip agreed to it if Ron agreed to go with him, so why hadn’t he? He had got through the first task, hadn’t he?

As though sensing its change of heart, Harry suddenly remembered what had happened in the graveyard a minute ago, and he dared not think about it any more. He sat up, however, and struck out again, recreating the dream he had had before he had left the hospital wing. This time, he only recalled the night before in the Auror’s chair, and the bird with the red eyes. He recalled telling Voldemort how he had subdued the sliver of moonlight that had illuminated the box around him, and describing how it had pecked his leg, and how Voldemort had put him into the Pensieve, and listened to his prayers as he expired. He recalled telling Moody exactly what had happened after he had left the box, and listened to him telling him how Cedric had died, and what his body had left behind. He decided to believe Moody, and decided to go to the Quidditch World Cup. He wanted to make sure that the story he had heard in the graveyard was true. He wanted to be sure that Moody, Horowitz, and Snape were absolutely sure that he was not dreaming. He took the map out of his robes, found his quill, and wrote to Sirius.\n",

He was wasting his time,’ Moody said, his voice rising still more forcefully, ‘your prayers were for naught. I gave him what he deserved, and I will reward him beyond anything else.’\n",

I tell you now,’ he added, getting louder now, and his voice echoed as though it was coming from an hourglass window, ‘that's not the way it is supposed to work. It’s not polite for a Muggle to arrive too late. You’re supposed to wait until everyone’s had a good night’s sleep.’\n",

After breakfast, they took a right, and a left, turning right at the same moment, so that Harry was facing the right bank of the river, and Cedric the left.\n",

So they arranged for me to meet these Miss Vár</name>, and we became fast friends. I told her all about my little war, and about my dad. She invited me to stay with her in the mountains.

Mr Weasley spent most of his time in the surrounding common room, which was now completely empty and gloomy. There was a strange lack of activity there, too, compared with the fast-paced world of the castle.

Beyond him, the roofs of the nearby parks cracked and echoed with thunderous yells and footsteps. Death Eaters were emerging from the darkness, taking aim … Dumbledore was here … he was alive … he was kicking … he was trying to save his master …<br><br>The discharge made Harry jump. He and Cedric made a run for it; he heard Voldemort screaming, but he didn’t swing to save himself; he fell, hard, onto the ground; the Death Eaters laughed and leered at him.<br><br>For a moment, Harry just stood there, looking at the Death Eaters, then, with a mad, incoherent wave of his wand, a small piece of parchment flew out of the Death Eaters’ palms, and shaped her into a woman.<br><br>*<br><br>It was a girl … yet she was very much like his father. The dark circles under her eyes were suddenly illuminated; she had a shiny, whitish hair that was fluttering in the breeze; she was changing into a small round-table atmosphere, and she walked up and down talking to everyone in the room. Her robes were much more delicate than those of her father’s – perhaps they were because she had been so long in the thick of it – and she took much longer to draw her first few sentences.<br><br>‘ … and I have no wish to die on my own terms, nor do I care very much for the rules which prevent me doing so. I will die swinging from my chair, ready and willing to use the last of my might to restore order to a system which I see is full of murderers and thugs. I see no difference between me and the giants. I look around me and see only criminals.’<br><br>There was a very tense moment’s silence, during which Mr Weasley peered over Harry’s shoulder repeatedly. Then, very hastily, Mr Weasley said, ‘All right, Harry?’<br><br>‘Yeah,’ said Harry, anyway.<br><br>‘You know, though, that this might be a bit much for you … you have been through a lot to get here.’<br><br>‘What?’ said Harry. ‘I’m not asking you to join …’<br><br>‘No, Harry,’ said Mr Weasley, more urgently.</p>"

Every now and then, he would scrape his chin with his long nails and curl up, but in the past he had attacked Harry in conversation. Now he was crouched at the foot of the tree, his arms folded, his heavily bandaged hand on Harry’s hip, his tongue lolling around in his mouth, he looked slightly nauseous, but otherwise sane. Harry had few unanswered questions, but rather as many as he would ask, after a particularly painful lesson.<br><br>‘Where were you the night I threw away my Quidditch robes?’ he said, when Harry had explained the reason for his abrupt return to the castle. ‘The Slytherins saw me in the common room after the first task. They said I had disgraced the name of the champion.’<br><br>‘Ah, but you didn’t,’ said Harry. ‘You could have made a good Parselmouth.’<br><br>Voldemort chuckled again. ‘You are not a very good Parselmouth, Karkaroff … but you were very good, in fact,’ he said dismissively, looking down at Krum’s limp body, which lay scattered around the edge of the golden boat, and which, it seemed, had been prepared for this occasion. ‘I was afraid some of my less noble supporters would react badly with my return to the fold. I was right, indeed. Some feared that my return would be premature. I was attacked for daring to return to the fold after so long associating with it. I was threatened with arrest if I went outside it. Others wanted to see me punished more severely. I understood their motives, of course … I was interested only in punishing those who had once chosen me.’<br><br>Voldemort raised his wand, and pointed it at Krum. ‘Crucio, my Lord.’<br><br>Krum struggled for breath. Voldemort smiled as one who had watched a hundred kills listlessly glide by on his desk, and who now saw his own bare chest beginning to swim in glowing red sparks as it soared over the water to the basin.<br><br>He was screaming. The shrapnel in his face was echoing off the waterfall. He was cursing. Voldemort was yelling, ‘Crucify</p>"

He had been through worse; worse than this. The Gryffindor table was crowded and noisy; Malfoy spiked wine bottles had been flying everywhere; Hermione had almost thrown her pestle pouch to the floor; Mr Weasley had almost thrown his vegetable bundle to the ground; Mrs Weasley had almost thrown her first-aid bag; a punctured Humpty Dumpty onto the ground; Mrs Weasley had resorted to using the Herbology Tower to put out the fire. In the middle of the banquet, Harry sat down with them all again, and sat next to Ron. He couldn’t believe he had ever been this uncomfortable around Ron, the person he had become so attached to almost as soon as they had left the castle. The tension in the air was more than he could stand. Hermione was nervously avoiding his eyes; Harry was itching to pry into her very soul.<br><br>‘I’ve got to go and look for people who can’t use their voices above the ground,’ Harry said, settling himself down next to Ron. ‘Er – if you could tell us what’s happening at the Ministry, Ron, if you could tell us …’<br><br>‘Hmm,’ said Ron, looking thoughtful.<br><br>‘Yeah, anything that’ll help,’ said Harry, gesturing at his scar. ‘I’ve been wanting to tell them for ages, but … well, they’re not supposed to know … you’d have thought I was there just to watch them throw things around.’<br><br>‘Well, they probably are, aren’t they?’ said Ron. ‘I mean, they’re very popular, aren’t they?
